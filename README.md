# Graph Traversal

Using Djikstra's algorithm to find optimum routes for traversing undirected graphs written in C++.

Four Functions:

* Finding the shortest path from source to destination (NearestDriver)
* Finding the cost for shortest path traversal from a batch of source and destination inputs (QueryPrice)
* Finding the exact diameter of a graph (Diameter)
* Finding the approximate diameter of a graph (Diameter Approximation)
